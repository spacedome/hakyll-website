Static site generation with Hakyll.

The nix flake and build scripts were forked from Robert Pearce's [Hakyll Nix Template](https://github.com/rpearce/hakyll-nix-template) and are BSD licensed.
I recommend using his flake, setting up haskell.nix for this is a bit daunting if you aren't quite familiar with nix.
If you do, please show Robert some support.

I don't know why you'd want to, but please don't steal my blog posts lol. Thanks.
